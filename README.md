# Template Engine Benchmarks

This repository is based on the code from [haml/haml: HTML Abstraction Markup Language - A Markup Haiku](https://github.com/haml/haml).
The original source is [here](https://github.com/slim-template/slim/blob/v3.0.6/benchmarks/run-benchmarks.rb).
It is made into a separate repository to easily benchmark various template engines locally.

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/willnet/template-engine-benchmarks.git
cd template-engine-benchmarks
ruby run-benchmarks.rb
```
